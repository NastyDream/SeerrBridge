## üöÄ What is SeerrBridge?

üåâ **SeerrBridge** is a browser automation tool that integrates [Jellyseer](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)/[Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/) with [Debrid Media Manager](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/debrid-media-manager). It listens to movie requests via Overseerr webhook. It automates the torrent search and download process using Debrid Media Manager via browser automation, which in turn, gets sent to Real-Debrid. This streamlines your media management, making it fast and efficient.

üõ†Ô∏è **Why SeerrBridge?** 

**SeerrBridge** eliminates the need to set up multiple applications like [Radarr](https://radarr.video/), [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett), [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr), and other download clients. With SeerrBridge, you streamline your media management into one simple, automated process. No more juggling multiple tools‚Äîjust request and download!

Simply put, I was too lazy to set up all of these other applications (arrs) and thought.... I want this instead.

## ‚öô Requirements

Before you can run this script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

### 1. **Jellyseerr / Overseerr Notifications**
  - SeerrBridge should be running on the same machine that Jellyseerr / Overseerr is running on.

### 4. **Required Python Libraries**
   - You can install the required libraries by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

---

### Example `.env` File

Create a `.env` (or rename the example .env) file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
RD_ACCESS_TOKEN={"value":"YOUR_TOKEN","expiry":123456789}
RD_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
RD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
RD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
TRAKT_API_KEY=YOUR_TRAKT_TOKEN
OVERSEERR_API_KEY=YOUR_OVERSEERR_TOKEN
OVERSEERR_BASE=https://YOUR_OVERSEERR_URL.COM
HEADLESS_MODE=true
ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_BACKGROUND_TASK=true
REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES=120
TORRENT_FILTER_REGEX=^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Sending Notifications to SeerrBridge from Jellyseerr / Overseerr

Configure your webhook as mentioned above so SeerrBridge can ingest and process approval requests.


### Python Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Woahai321/SeerrBridge.git
   cd SeerrBridge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python seerrbridge.py
   ```

---

### üê≥ Docker Support

#### Option 1: Using Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Woahai321/SeerrBridge.git
    cd SeerrBridge
    ```

2. Copy the example `.env` file and update it with your specific configuration:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Example `.env`:
    ```bash
    RD_ACCESS_TOKEN={"value":"YOUR_TOKEN","expiry":123456789}
    RD_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
    RD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    RD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    TRAKT_API_KEY=YOUR_TRAKT_TOKEN
    OVERSEERR_API_KEY=YOUR_OVERSEERR_TOKEN
    OVERSEERR_BASE=https://YOUR_OVERSEERR_URL.COM
    HEADLESS_MODE=true
    ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_BACKGROUND_TASK=true
    REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES=120
    TORRENT_FILTER_REGEX=^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
    ```

3. Start the container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. Access the app at: [http://localhost:8777](http://localhost:8777).

---

#### Option 2: Using Docker Run

Skip Compose and run the container directly:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name seerrbridge \
  -p 8777:8777 \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  -e RD_ACCESS_TOKEN={"value":"YOUR_TOKEN","expiry":123456789} \
  -e RD_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN \
  -e RD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  -e RD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -e TRAKT_API_KEY=YOUR_TRAKT_TOKEN \
  -e OVERSEERR_API_KEY=YOUR_OVERSEERR_TOKEN \
  -e OVERSEERR_BASE=https://YOUR_OVERSEERR_URL.COM \
  -e HEADLESS_MODE=true \
  -e ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_BACKGROUND_TASK=true \
  -e REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES=120 \
  -e TORRENT_FILTER_REGEX=^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).* \
  ghcr.io/woahai321/seerrbridge:main
```
---

That's it! Your **SeerrBridge** container should now be up and running. üöÄ

---

## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] **Faster Processing**: Implement concurrency to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- [ ] **TV Show Support**: Extend functionality to handle TV series and episodes.
- [x] **DMM Token**: Ensure access token permanence/refresh
- [x] **Jellyseer/Overseer API Integration**: Direct integration with Jellyseer/Overseer API for smoother automation and control.
- [x] **Title Parsing**: Ensure torrent titles/names are properly matched and handle different languages.
- [x] **Docker Support**: Allow for Docker / Compose container.

---

## üîç How It Works

1. **Seerr Webhook**: SeerrBridge listens for movie requests via the configured webhook.
2. **Automated Search**: It uses Selenium to automate the search for movies on Debrid Media Manager site.
3. **Torrent Fetching**: Once a matching torrent is found, SeerrBridge automates the Real-Debrid download process.
4. **Queue Management**: Requests are added to a queue and processed one by one, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

If you want to see the automation working in real-time, you can edit the .env and set it to false

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1e9cdb-ff59-41fa-8a71-ccbff0f3c210)

This will launch a visible Chrome browser. Be sure not to mess with it while it's operating or else you will break the current action/script and need a re-run.

Example:

## üéØ Custom Regex Filtering

This script includes support for **custom regex filtering**, allowing you to filter out unwanted items and refine the results based on specific patterns. The regex is automatically added when the script runs, and you can customize it directly in the code.

### Default Regex

The currently used regex is:

```python
^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

#### What It Does:
- **Exclude Items with `„Äê...„Äë`**: `(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)` removes items with formatted text in this style.
- **Exclude Cyrillic Characters**: `(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])` removes items containing characters from Cyrillic scripts (e.g., Russian text).
- **Exclude Items with `[esp]`**: `(?!.*\[esp\])` removes items explicitly marked as `[esp]` (often denoting Spanish content).
- **Match All Other Content**: `.*` ensures the filter applies to the rest of the string.

This is a broad exclusion-based filter that removes unwanted patterns without requiring specific inclusions.

---

### Optional Regex (Filtering by Resolution)

If you'd like to refine the filter further to only match items containing **1080p** or **2160p**, you can use the following optional regex:

```python
^(?=.*(1080p|2160p))(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

#### What It Does:
- **Include Only Items with `1080p` or `2160p`**: `(?=.*(1080p|2160p))` ensures that only items with these resolutions are processed.
- The rest of the filter (**exclude `„Äê...„Äë`, Cyrillic characters, or `[esp]`**) works the same as in the default regex.

---

### How to Use

To switch between the default and optional regex, simply update the `.env` file:

- **Default Regex**:
    ```python
    ^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
    ```

- **Optional Regex**:
    ```python
    ^(?=.*(1080p|2160p))(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
    ```

This gives you flexibility to define what gets filtered, based on your preferred criteria.


## üìú List of Regex Examples

Below is a categorized list of regex patterns for different filtering possibilities.

---

### 1. **Current Filter**
```regex
^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

---

### 2. **Current Filter with Resolutions**
```regex
^(?=.*(1080p|2160p))(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

---

### 3. **Current Filter with Torrent Types**
```regex
^(?=.*(Remux|BluRay|BDRip|BRRip))(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

---

### 4. **Filter with Both Types and Resolutions**
```regex
^(?=.*(1080p|2160p))(?=.*(Remux|BluRay|BDRip|BRRip))(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

---

### 5. **Filter for Specific Resolution Only**
```regex
^(?=.*(1080p|2160p)).*
```

---

### 6. **Filter for Specific Torrent Types Only**
```regex
^(?=.*(Remux|BluRay|BDRip|BRRip)).*
```

---

### 7. **Customizable Regex Template**
```regex
^(?=.*(1080p|2160p))?(?=.*(Remux|BluRay|BDRip|BRRip))?(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

---

By selecting one of these patterns, you can tailor the regex filter to fit your exact needs.
